# Large and Multi-modality Satellite Datasets
A Benchmark for Large-Scale and Multi-modality Remote Sensing Datasets.

With the continuous enrichment of remote sensing data and the rapid advancement of large model technologies, numerous large-scale remote sensing datasets for tasks such as pre-training and image generation have been successively released. To facilitate a better understanding and utilization of these datasets, we compile and summarize the currently available resources, with a particular focus on globally distributed and multimodal datasets.
